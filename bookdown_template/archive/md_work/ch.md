### Scary math {.unnumbered}

$$\Theta = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta\\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}$$

### R code and data {.unnumbered}

These are "code chunks"


```
##  [1]  0.69 -1.36 -0.53  0.45  2.06 -0.37  1.90  1.21 -1.20 -0.27
```

And I can refer to the results of the r code in the text itself, e.g., by writing

    ``  one plus one equals  ` r x `   ``

I get ... one plus one equals 2.

### Tables and graphs

We can make tables from data (but these might struggle exporting to markdown formats?)

Below, this defaults to an html  styling

(but in the md substitution code I swap in 'pipe styling')

<table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<caption>don't forget a caption</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> cyl </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> n </th>
   <th style="text-align:right;"> percent </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 4 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 11 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.34 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 6 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 7 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.22 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 8 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 14 </td>
   <td style="text-align:right;"> 0.44 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
And using the gtsummary package:





And of course, graphs aka 'visualisations':

## Types of notes within text

**Note**: 

"Aside" notes look like this.



**Note**: 

Warnings look like this.



### A margin note

What about tufte-style margin notes? ^[

\* If you are considering pursuing an MSc or PhD this will typically be centered on doing research; it's worth knowing whether this is for you before diving in. Doing research is also a key component of much professional work in the private and public (government) sectors, including at 'think tanks', some government agencies, and many private consulting and 'data analytics' firms.

### A fun acronym

**Six simple rules for writing a good paper** (and, incidentally, for getting a good mark)

1.  Frame your topic as an interesting, well-defined **Economic** question. Demonstrate that you understand your question.

2.  Explain what others have written about your topic and which techniques they used. [**Critically**](#crit_examine) **discuss** the strengths and limitations these. Explain how these relate to and inform your own work. Cite correctly and do not plagiarise.

3.  **Apply economics** (and econometrics) to your question. Demonstrate an understanding of your approach and techniques.

4.  **Organise and present** your work clearly, including an outline and labels and explanations of any tables, graphs, and equations.

5.  Write clearly, logically, and in a professional **academic** style.

6.  If you are aiming to produce a great paper, make an original contribution or **insight.** (This can be a small insight, and it is not always necessary for a top mark.)
