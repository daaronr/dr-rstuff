Note to friends I’ve asked to look at this book… Thanks for looking at this. 0.1 Preface Leaving feedback, asking questions, seeking other’s feedback/notes/questions: All feedback is appreciated, and I will try to respond to your questions. An easy way to take notes and leave feedback: sign up for ‘hypothes.is’ and you can put your ‘public notes’ directly on this web book. Don’t worry, these comments are saved even if the web book is updated. an example of a quotation example of a quotation example of a quotation example of a quotation example of a quotation example of a quotation example of a quotation example of a quotation example of a quotation. ddddddd This book is in Open Review.

Testing another one: (Alec Stephenson 2013) It is referring the contents of bibtex files, in the line bibliography: [./references.bib, support/reinstein_bibtex.bib] This can be made easier with the addin citation tool ‘citr’, along with Zotero and betterbibtex. 0.3 Examples of the sort of fancy interactive stuff I hope to incorporate in this web book Thanks to Yihui and many others, this book should permit lots of flexible tools. Trying some of these below (with code shown, but it could also be hidden). Thanks Yihui for the Bookdown package. 0.3.1 Questions with folded answers, folded expanded discussions Can I ask you a question? (Answer below the fold.) Yes: I just did. I can also put expansive detail into the fold, to avoid clutter. If you want to know more about spittlebugs, feel free (to open the fold below). These families are best known for the nymphal stage, which produces a cover of foamed-up plant sap visually resembling saliva; the nymphs are therefore commonly known as spittlebugs and their foam as cuckoo spit, frog spit, or snake spit. This characteristic spittle production is associated with the unusual trait of xylem feeding. Whereas most insects that feed on sap feed on the nutrient-rich fluid from the phloem, Cercopidae utilize the much more dilute sap flowing upward from the roots via the xylem. The large amount of excess water that must be excreted and the evolution of special breathing tubes allow the young spittlebug nymphs to grown in the relatively protective environment of the spittle.

Warnings look like this. 0.4.1 A margin note If you are considering pursuing an MSc or PhD this will typically be centered on doing research; it’s worth knowing whether this is for you before diving in. Doing research is also a key component of much professional work in the private and public (government) sectors, including at ‘think tanks’, some government agencies, and many private consulting and ‘data analytics’ firms.

Demonstrate that you understand your question. Explain what others have written about your topic and which techniques they used. Critically discuss the strengths and limitations these. Explain how these relate to and inform your own work. Cite correctly and do not plagiarise. Apply economics (and econometrics) to your question. Demonstrate an understanding of your approach and techniques. Organise and present your work clearly, including an outline and labels and explanations of any tables, graphs, and equations. Write clearly, logically, and in a professional academic style. If you are aiming to produce a great paper, make an original contribution or insight. (This can be a small insight, and it is not always necessary for a top mark.)

Please contact me directly for details. Large lectures have limited value in this context. From my experience students appreciate occasional lectures for motivation and clarification, and to ask questions, but more than 5-6 traditional lectures seems to be overkill. If resources permit, it will be helpful to intersperse this with casual scheduled ‘research coffees’, encouraging students to discuss their ideas with instructors and with each other. I recommend a ‘light-touch approach’ in sessions. Let the students take the lead in presenting and responding (making occasional course-corrections where necessary). From our experience, students engage actively in these contexts! "],
