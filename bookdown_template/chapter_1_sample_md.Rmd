## Citations

Let's cite a paper here: [@Akerlof1984a]; I don't think I needed the brackets though (@Akerlof1984a would also have worked).

Testing another one: [@alecstephensonQuickIntroductionShiny2013]

It is referring the contents of bibtex files, in the line `bibliography: [./references.bib, support/reinstein_bibtex.bib]`

This can be made easier with the addin citation tool 'citr', along with Zotero and betterbibtex.

## Examples of the sort of fancy interactive stuff one can incorporate in this web book

Thanks to Yihui and many others, this book should permit lots of flexible tools. Trying some of these below (with code shown, but it could also be hidden). Thanks Yihui for the [Bookdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

We can have internal links to previous sections like [here, to the about section](#about).



### Questions with folded answers, folded expanded discussions

Can I ask you a question? (Answer below the fold.)

^[

Yes: I just did.

]

\




I can also put expansive detail into a fold, to avoid clutter. If you want to know more about spittlebugs, feel free (to open the fold below).

^[

> These families are best known for the nymphal stage, which produces a cover of foamed-up plant sap visually resembling saliva; the nymphs are therefore commonly known as spittlebugs and their foam as cuckoo spit, frog spit, or snake spit. This characteristic spittle production is associated with the unusual trait of xylem feeding. Whereas most insects that feed on sap feed on the nutrient-rich fluid from the phloem, Cercopidae utilize the much more dilute sap flowing upward from the roots via the xylem. The large amount of excess water that must be excreted and the evolution of special breathing tubes allow the young spittlebug nymphs to grown in the relatively protective environment of the spittle.

### A Shiny app {#shiny_test .unnumbered}

```{r knitrapp}

#knitr::include_app("https://yihui.shinyapps.io/miniUI/", height = "600px")

```

### My web pages {.unnumbered}

[innovationsinfundraising.org](https://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php)

(This page couldn't embed)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r wppage}

#knitr::include_url("https://davidreinstein.wordpress.com/")

```

### Scary math {.unnumbered}

$$\Theta = \begin{pmatrix}\alpha & \beta\\
\gamma & \delta
\end{pmatrix}$$

### R code and data {.unnumbered}

These are "code chunks"

```{r chunk-label, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = 'A figure caption.'}
x <- 1 + 1
rnorm(10)  # 10 random numbers
plot(dist ~ speed, cars)  # a scatterplot
```

And I can refer to the results of the r code in the text itself, e.g., by writing

    ``  one plus one equals  ` r x `   ``

I get ... one plus one equals `r x`.

### Tables and graphs

We can make tables from data (but these might struggle exporting to markdown formats?)

Below, this defaults to an html  styling

(but in the md substitution code I swap in 'pipe styling')

```{r, results='asis'}

mtcars %>% as_tibble() %>%
  tabyl(cyl) %>%
  .kable(format='pipe', caption="don't forget a caption" )



```



And of course, graphs aka 'visualisations':

```{r}
(
mtcars_plot <- mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mpg))
+ geom_histogram(binwidth=5)
)
```


### Other fancy stuff {.unnumbered}

```{r, eval = "html", results='asis', echo=F, purl=F}
cat('
<div class = "keyconcept" id="KC5.4">
<h3 class = "right"> Key Concept 5.4 </h3>
<h3 class = "left"> Heteroskedasticity and Homoskedasticity </h3>
- The error term of our regression model is homoskedastic if the variance of the conditional distribution of $u_i$ given $X_i$, $Var(u_i|X_i=x)$, is constant *for all* observations in our sample:
\\[ \\text{Var}(u_i|X_i=x) = \\sigma^2 \\ \\forall \\ i=1,\\dots,n. \\]

</div>
')
```

### Interactive questions

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_app('https://os301.shinyapps.io/Question/', height = "210px")

#Code for this is detailed below
# library(shiny)
# ui <- fluidPage(
#     radioButtons("rb", "In equilibrium what is Quantity demanded equal to?",
#                        choiceNames =
#                            list("None selected", "Quantity Supplied", "Bananas",
#                                 "Apples", "Pears"),
#                        choiceValues =
#                            list("", "supply", "demand", "price", "quantity"),
#                  selected = ""
#     ),
#     textOutput("txt")
#     )
# server <- function(input, output) {
#     output$txt <- renderText({
#         if (input$rb == "supply"){
#             print("You are correct")
#             } else if (input$rb == ""){
#                 print("")}
#                 else{
#                     print("You are incorrect")}
#             })
# }
# shinyApp(ui, server)
```

### Videos

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::include_app('https://os301.shinyapps.io/Video/')
# Code for this is detailed below
# library(shiny)
# ui <- fluidPage(
#     HTML('<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WyrhmqHfdu8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>')
# )
# server <- function(input, output, session) {

# shinyApp(ui, server)

## Types of notes within text

**Note**:

"Aside" notes look like this.



**Note**:

Warnings look like this.



### A margin note

What about tufte-style margin notes? \*

^[

\* If you are considering pursuing an MSc or PhD this will typically be centered on doing research; it's worth knowing whether this is for you before diving in. Doing research is also a key component of much professional work in the private and public (government) sectors, including at 'think tanks', some government agencies, and many private consulting and 'data analytics' firms.

### A fun acronym

**Six simple rules for writing a good paper** (and, incidentally, for getting a good mark)

1.  Frame your topic as an interesting, well-defined **Economic** question. Demonstrate that you understand your question.

2.  Explain what others have written about your topic and which techniques they used. [**Critically**](#crit_examine) **discuss** the strengths and limitations these. Explain how these relate to and inform your own work. Cite correctly and do not plagiarise.

3.  **Apply economics** (and econometrics) to your question. Demonstrate an understanding of your approach and techniques.

4.  **Organise and present** your work clearly, including an outline and labels and explanations of any tables, graphs, and equations.

5.  Write clearly, logically, and in a professional **academic** style.

6.  If you are aiming to produce a great paper, make an original contribution or **insight.** (This can be a small insight, and it is not always necessary for a top mark.)

```{r  fig.cap = 'Just remember...', out.width='40%', fig.asp=.4, fig.align='center',  echo = FALSE}

#knitr::include_graphics("images/ecacoacin4life.jpg")

```

Just remember the simple acronym "ECAOAcIn":[^chapter_1_sample-1]

**E**conomic question -- **C**ritical discussion -- **A**pply economics -- **O**rganise/present well -- **Ac**ademic writing -- original **In**sight
