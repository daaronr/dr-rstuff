	abstract = {This paper presents an experimental test of the proposition that government
contributions to public goods, funded by lump-sum taxation, will
completely crowd out voluntary contributions. It is found that crowding-out
is incomplete and that subjects who are taxed are significantly more
cooperative. This is true even though the tax does not affect the
Nash equilibrium prediction. This result is taken as evidence for
alternative models that assume people experience some private benefit
from contributing to public goods.},

@article{Andreoni2006a,
	abstract = {Why do charities often begin new capital fund drives by announcing
a large contribution by a single wealthy donor? This paper explores
the possibility that such "leadership giving" provides a signal to
all other givers that the charity is of high quality. The dilemma
is that if the lead giver can deceive others to believe the charity
is of higher quality than it truly is, then these followers will
make larger contributions, which will benefit the leader. Hence,
the leader must give an unusually large amount to convey a credible
signal of the quality. This sets up a war-of-attrition game for who
will pay the cost to signal the quality. Since the wealthy have the
lowest opportunity cost of providing the signal, they, in equilibrium,
move first to provide the signal of quality with exceptionally large
gifts.},

@article{Duncan2004,
	abstract = {This article develops a new model of altruism called impact philanthropy.
An impact

philanthropist is someone who wants to personally ‘make a difference.'
While that motive is

straightforward, its logical implications are significantly different
from other models of philanthropy.

For example, the contributions of other donors can reduce an impact
philanthropist's charitable

fulfillment. As a result, cooperation among impact philanthropists
can reduce aggregate giving. In

addition, impact philanthropy can lead to a codependent relationship
between givers and receivers in

which both benefit from the other. Finally, the model suggests a conflict
between charitable

organizations and its donors concerning the allocation of charitable
gifts. In particular, a charitable

organization prefers to spread a donor's contribution across many
goods, whereas a donor prefers to

target his or her contribution at a specific good.},
